# EU referendum data analysis - Attitudes to the free market and free movement of people

The EU referendum told us that the majority view of the UK electorate was on the 23rd June was to leave the EU. It does not give us any concrete evidence about motivated the electorate to make that decision. 

There is a widespread assumption in the media, and in the UK government's statements about brexit so far, that the control of free movement of workers was a important objective for the electorate when voting to leave the EU. This assumption has influenced the nature and tone of the negotiation regarding the UK leaving the EU so far. 

To test the validity of this assumption we conducted an online survey of 1639 participants on the 20th July. The results were as follows:

The results of this survey demonstrate that a majority of participants believe that the advantages to the UK of access to the EU free market outweigh any disadvantages of the free movement of workers across the EU. Or, from another perspective, only one quarter of the population would advocate an outcome that controls free movement from the EU, if that resulted in loss of access to the free market.

This seems at odds with the current assumptions driving the UK government policy.  We recommend that a much more detailed understanding of the UK electorate's motivations in voting to leave the EU is established, before any negotiations with the EU are started.
