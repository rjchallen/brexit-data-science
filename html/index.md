# EU referendum data analysis

## Summary

The EU referendum result tells us the "what" but not the "why" with regards to leaving the EU. There is an assumption being made that the control of immigration is very important to the UK electorate. This is having a strong influence on the nature and tone of the ongoing debate around the UK leaving the EU. We conducted a survey that shows that a significant majority believe that the advantages to the UK of access to the EU free market outweigh any disadvantages of the free movement of workers across the EU. This is at odds with the current assumptions driving the UK government policy. We recommend that before any negotiations with the EU are started, a much more detailed understanding of the UK electorate's motivations in voting to leave the EU is established. 

There is a second assumption that due to the number of votes cast, and the margin of the leave vote, that the EU referendum is a reliable indicator of the will of the UK electorate. However the referendum result only represents a single point in time, and, apart from not voting, or voiding a ballot paper, there was no option to express voter uncertainty. We conducted a survey to look at whether people would change their vote if they could and found some evidence that between 10 and 20% of the voting population were dissatisfied with their vote. The result is very hard to interpret though as there appears to be a large number of people in the sample who are mis-reporting their voting behaviour in the EU referendum.

## Introduction

The EU referendum vote reflected the attitude of the people to the European Union on the 24th June 2016. As we know the majority of voters elected to leave the EU. Since then there have been a number calls for a second referendum, but the UK government is so far committed to delivering what they believe is the will of the people, and in particular negotiating to control the free movement of people into the UK.

There appear to be 2 assumptions in this position for which there has been limited evidence. Firstly that the referendum result infers that the UK population wishes to control immigration, and secondly that the EU referendum result represents the consistent will of the people, and still does so.

To test these assumptions YouGov have conducted an online survey of 1639 people representative of the EU referendum voting population, to try and find evidence to support or refute these two assumptions.

## Attitudes to the free market and free movement of people

### Background

The result of the EU referendum recommends the UK government leave the EU, but does not give any information about the reasons for chosing this path. This is an issue as the process of triggering Article 50 has many potential outcomes, and the UK government has no predetermined negotiating position. The campaigns on both sides of the argument addressed issues such as the cost of EU membership, the risk to UK workers posed by immigration, lack of democratic accountability and transparency in the European Commission, and loss of sovereignty. However we do not have any concrete evidence which of those issues affected the decision making of the population, or continues to influence that decision making. As a result the government does not know what outcome to aim for when negotiating to leave the EU.

It seems important for the UK economy that we are able to trade freely trade with the EU. The issue of free movement of people is incredibly important to the EU, and any negotiation based in the UK having access to the free trade zone without free movement of people is likely to be fraught and prolonged.

There has been an assumption made that control of the free movement of people is a key issue for the UK electorate, and hence should be a central focus of the negotiation following enactment of Article 50. This assumption places a great deal of uncertainty over the future of the UK's access to the EU market. This in turn is affecting confidence in the UK, reducing investment into the UK from Europe, creating cultural barriers to businesses that rely on Europe, and fostering ill will in Europe during the negotiation period, as the role of EU nationals in the UK is placed into doubt. The economic risks associated with this negotiaing position may be able to be controlled, but there are also reputational and socio-cultural risks resulting from the ill will that may be less able to be controlled.
