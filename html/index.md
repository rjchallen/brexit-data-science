# EU referendum data analysis

## Summary

## Background

The EU referendum vote reflected the attitude of the people to the European Union on the 24th June 2016. As we know the majority of voters elected to leave the EU. Since then there have been a number calls for a second referendum, but the UK government is so far committed to delivering what they believe is the will of the people, and in particular negotiating to control the flow of workers into the UK.

There appear to be 2 assumptions in this position for which there is limited evidence. Firstly that the referendum result infers that the UK population wishes to control immigration, and secondly that the EU referendum result truly represents the will of the people, and still does so.   

## Attitudes to the free market and free movement of people

The result of the EU referendum gives the UK government a indication of what to do, but does not give any information why the electorate decided to chose this path. The campaigns on both sides of the argument addressed issues such as the cost of EU membership, the risk to UK workers posed by immigration, lack of democratic accountability and transparency  in the European Commission, and loss of sovereignty. However we do not know which of those issues affected the decision making of the population, or continues to influence that decision making. 

It seems important for the UK economy that we are able to trade freely trade with the EU. The issue of free movement of people is incredibly important to the EU, and a negotiation around the UK having access to the free trade zone without free movement of people is likely to be fraught and prolonged.

There has been an assumption in the media and possibly in the government that control of the free movement of people is a key issue for the UK electorate, and that it must be a focus of the negotiation following enactment of Article 50. This assumption places a great deal of uncertainty over the future of the UK's access to the EU market. This in turn is affecting confidence in the UK, reducing investment into the UK from Europe, and creating cultural barriers to businesses that rely on Europe, and fostering ill will in Europe during the negotiation period.
