# EU referendum data analysis

## Summary

The EU referendum informed us of what the UK electorate wanted to do on the 23rd June but does not tell us the "why". There seems to be an assumption being made that the control of free movement of workers, was a very important fator in the electorates vote to leave the EU. This assumption influences the nature and tone of the negotiation regarding the UK leaving the EU. To test the validity of this assumption we conducted an online survey of 1683 participants. This survey demonstrates that a significant majority believe that the advantages to the UK of access to the EU free market outweigh any disadvantages of the free movement of workers across the EU (63% agree: 37% disagree). This appears at odds with the current assumptions driving the UK government policy. We recommend that before any negotiations with the EU are started, a much more detailed understanding of the UK electorate's motivations in voting to leave the EU is established. 

There is a second assertion that has appeared frequently in the media, that because of the relatively high turnout, and the margin of the leave vote, that the EU referendum is a reliable indicator of the will of the UK electorate. The referendum represents a single point in time, and the liklihood that people vote consistently is a third factor that influences the repeatability of the result. If that voter uncertainty is high then the referendum result may be "volatile" and highly sensitive to change. We conducted a survey to assess voter predictability, by asking whether people would change their vote if they could vote in another referendum. We found some evidence that between 10 and 20% of the voting population would consider changing their vote. These results are very hard to interpret, as there appears to be a isolated and systematic mis-reporting of EU voting behaviour in the sample, with more people claiming to have voted remain than is likely from the referendum result.

## Introduction

The EU referendum vote reflected the attitude of the people to the European Union on the 23th June 2016. As we know the majority of voters elected to leave the EU. Since then there have been a number calls for a second referendum, but the UK government is so far committed to delivering what they believe is the will of the people, and in particular negotiating to control the free movement of people into the UK.

There appear to be 2 assumptions in this position for which there has been limited evidence. Firstly that the referendum result infers that the UK population wishes to control immigration, and secondly that the EU referendum result represents the consistent will of the people, and still does so.

To test these assumptions YouGov have conducted an online survey of 1639 people representative of the EU referendum voting population, to try and find evidence to support or refute these two assumptions.

## Attitudes to the free market and free movement of people

### Background

The result of the EU referendum recommends the UK government leave the EU, but does not give any information about the reasons for chosing this path. This is an issue as the process of triggering Article 50 has many potential outcomes, and the UK government has no predetermined negotiating position. The campaigns on both sides of the argument addressed issues such as the cost of EU membership, the risk to UK workers posed by immigration, lack of democratic accountability and transparency in the European Commission, and loss of sovereignty. However we do not have any concrete evidence which of those issues affected the decision making of the population, or continues to influence that decision making. As a result the government cannot know what outcome to aim for when negotiating to leave the EU.

It seems important for the UK economy that we are able to trade freely trade with the EU. The issue of free movement of people is incredibly important to the EU, and any negotiation based in the UK having access to the free trade zone without free movement of people is likely to be fraught and prolonged.

There has been an assumption made that control of the free movement of people is a key issue for the UK electorate, and hence should be a central focus of the negotiation following enactment of Article 50. This assumption places a great deal of uncertainty over the future of the UK's access to the EU market. This in turn is affecting confidence in the UK, reducing investment into the UK from Europe, creating cultural barriers to businesses that rely on Europe, and fostering ill will in Europe during the negotiation period, as the role of EU nationals in the UK is placed into doubt. The economic risks associated with this negotiating position may be possible to control, but there are also reputational and socio-cultural risks resulting from it that may not be possible to control. 

### Method

To assess the UK populations attitude to the UK government's negotiating position around immigration we asked the following question:

"The advantages to the UK of access to the EU free market outweigh any disadvantages of the free movement of workers across the EU."

With responses on a 5 point Likert scale ("Strongly agree, "Agree", "Not sure", "Disagree", "Strongly disagree"). To a sample of 1638 people using an online survey.

The sample included some representation from all demographic groups across 6 broad regions of the UK (London, Rest of the South, Midlands and Wales, North of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland). There was some sample bias noted with a moderate under-representation of 18-24 year old males in London, and in the Midlands / Wales, and over representation of females of all age groups in the Rest of the South. A weighting was applied to correct this sample bias based on demographics.

The sample included people who voted across the political spectrum in the 2015 general election. The proportions were compared to the known outcome of the election, and a significant under-representation of people who did not vote in the last election was noted. This suggests that there is a disengaged cohort in the population that neither voted in the 2015 election nor responds to surveys, and our sample is only really looking at engaged voters. It is likely the statistical significance of this disengaged group affects all results equally, but this is a potential source of bias in the results.

The other potential biases identified for surveys of this type is a central tendency bias, and agreement bias. It is not possible to control for these given the design of the survey. 

### Results

The top level results for this question shows

![attitudes to the free market and free movement of people][question1]

After applying weighting functions for demographics and political orientation the following weighted results were obtained:

![attitudes to the free market and free movement of people - adjusted][question1weighted]

We can look at these results broken down by the political orientation of the voters based on their reported vote in the 2015 general election.

### Discussion

This survey shows 40.6% of the population agree that the benefits of free trade with the EU outweigh any disadvantages of free movement of people, and only 23.8% percent disagree, with 35.5% uncertain. 

Whilst this does not represent an absolute majority of the sample population, if we discount those who are uncertain (in line with the EU referendum itself), this represents a 63.0% to 37.0% split in favour of free trade and free movement of people. This is clearly a more significant result than the 51.9% to 48.1% split seen on the 24th June (albeit on a small sample).

The implication of this result is that whilst the UK voted to leave the EU, it was not done solely on the basis of concerns over the levels of immigration from the EU. In seems likely that the immigration issue alone would not have been enough to cause the electorate to vote to leave the EU.

When we examine the political breakdown we need to be cautious as the smaller sample size of the subdivided groups affects the confidence of our figures. However we can see a clear division between the various political parties. Conservative voters appear evenly split between agreement and disagreement, UKIP supporters are clearly in general disagreement, and the other political parties (including the SNP in the "other" category) demonstrate varying degrees of agreement with the principle that benefits of free trade outweigh disadvantages of free movement of people. This is in line with expectation, based on the political rhetoric of the parties. 

However this split raises an awkward question for the Conservative government and its strategy for negotiation with the EU. How can the Conservative government develop a negotiating position around free trade and free movement of people, that is in line with the attitudes of the whole population demonstrated by this survey, despite their core voters being equivocal on it, and a group of possible target voters being opposed to it. The interests of the whole UK versus the interests of the Conservative party appear to be misaligned, and this could have very far reaching consequences.

### Recommendations

We've looked at one facet of the decision making around the vote to leave, at a very superficial level. There are likely to be nuances that we cannot pick up with a small sample and affect the most appropriate strategy. 

In this analysis we see that the assumption that the issue of the free movement of people within the EU is a big concern for the electorate is not supported by the evidence. There are other issues such as the cost of EU membership, or erosion of sovereignty, that may well be far more important to the electorate as a whole. It is important that the government actively seeks evidence, about what issues are of central concern to the UK population before they trigger Article 50.

As the Conservative government are potentially in a conflicted position, it would appear doubly important that they find some concrete evidence to base their decision making on.
