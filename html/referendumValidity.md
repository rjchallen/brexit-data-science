# EU referendum data analysis

DRAFT
15/8/2016

## Summary

The EU referendum told us what the UK electorate wanted to do on the 23rd June. It does not tell us why. There is a widespread assumption that the control of free movement of workers, was a very important factor in the electorate's vote to leave the EU. This assumption influences the nature and tone of the negotiation regarding the UK leaving the EU. To test the validity of this assumption we conducted an online survey of 1683 participants using YouGov's omnibus service. The results of this survey demonstrate that a significant majority of participants believe that the advantages to the UK of access to the EU free market outweigh any disadvantages of the free movement of workers across the EU (63% agree: 37% disagree). This seems at odds with the current assumptions driving the UK government policy. We recommend that before any negotiations with the EU are started, a much more detailed understanding of the UK electorate's motivations in voting to leave the EU is established. 

There is a second assertion that has appeared frequently in the media, that because of the relatively high turnout, and the margin of the leave vote, that the EU referendum is a reliable indicator of the will of the UK electorate. The referendum represents a single point in time, and the liklihood that people vote consistently is a third factor that influences the repeatability of the result. If that voter uncertainty is high then the referendum result may be "volatile" and highly sensitive to change. We conducted a survey to assess voter predictability, by asking whether people would change their vote if they could vote in another referendum. We found some evidence that between 10 and 20% of the voting population would consider changing their vote. These results are very hard to interpret, as there appears to be a isolated and systematic mis-reporting of EU voting behaviour in the sample, with more people claiming to have voted remain than is likely from the referendum result.

  ## Reliability of the EU referendum result

### Background

### Method

### Results

The top level results for this question shows

![voter volatility][question2]

After applying weighting functions for demographics and political orientation the following weighted results were obtained:

![voter volatility - adjusted][question2weighted]

We can look at these results broken down by the political orientation of the voters based on their reported vote in the 2015 general election. 

![voter volatility - political party breakdown][question2byPolitics]

Or by reported vote in EU referendum. However this cannot be easily interpreted at there is significant reporting bias on the response to the EU referendum vote.
