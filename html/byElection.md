# Voter disaffection in Richmond and Witney

The outcome of the Witney and Richmond by elections both showed considerable relative swings in relative voter support towards the Liberal Democrats, as the party representing a anti-brexit view. What is less obvious is the drop in absolute numbers of voters who turned out to vote for the other parties. If we look at the two by election results together and compare the voters who voted for the different parties we see a huge drop in both conservative and labour voters.

The Conservatives (including Zac Goldsmith as the Conservative representative in Richmond) are only managing to persuade 51% of the voters who came out at the general election, to vote for them again, and Labour put in an even worse showing at 46%. The Liberal Democrats on the other hand are getting 2 votes in the by elections post brexit, for every vote they got in the 2015 general election. This is a significant shift.

We modelled what the outcome of this shift could be, if it were replicated country wide, on the distribution of seats in the parliament given a theoretical snap election tomorrow.

Based on these 2 by election results our modelling shows a 89 seat gain by the Liberal Democrats, the majority coming from existing Labour seats, where their margins are smaller, but a significant number (22 including Richmond) from Conservative seats. This would result in a hung parliament, with the Lib Dems and SNP holding the balance of power. This would not be a strong enough force to alter the outcome of a Conservative and Labour whipped vote for triggering Article 50, but it does suggest that the next government could have a significant difficulty achieving consensus. Clearly this is extrapolating from very limited data. 

The predictions also can identify particular seats that are most vunerable to a voter backlash caused by brexit. In these seats the incumbent party is most at odds with its constituencies and if the existing voting patterns are replicated will show a large shift to anti-brexit parties.

In this analysis we see that Richmond is a highly likely to be won by the Liberal Democrats as we indeed have seen. Hornsey and Wood Green, Bristol, Endinburg, Manchester (Withington), Cambridge and Bermondsey are all areas where voter disaffection is likely to be very high for Labour, similarly, Bath, Twickenham, St Albans, Oxford and winchester, will become losses for the Conservatives. It is in these areas that the incumbent MP is in a party that is least representative of their constituents, and where there is a high likelihood they will lose the next election to an anti-brexit party.

Following a close remain vote, the Scottish electorate swung away from the pro-UK parties towards the pro-independence SNP. We may see the opposite effect in the UK where the close leave vote results in a swing towards the pro-EU parties. The SNP are well placed to benefit from both effects.
